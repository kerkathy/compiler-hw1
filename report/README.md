## How much time did you spend on this project
around 16 hours

## Project overview

Describe the project structure and how you implemented it.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

For me it's the floating-point constant and scientific constant. I repeatedly misunderstood the definition and revised my code many times to fit the requirements.
Also the string constant part took me a long while to figure out the approriate way to deal with the double quote. (TKS to TA's help by the way!) To my surprise, I directly pass the test in this part without modifying anything! 

## Feedback to T.A.s

Overall, the explanation is super clear and the hints are indeed helpful. TA's answer about my question also helped A LOT. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart!!
However, in my humble opinion, the explanation in the scientific section is a little bit unclear. It'll be perfect if it's modified as :

where the coefficient a is a nonzero real number (a nonzero ***DECIMAL*** integer or a nonzero floating-point decimal number)

I'm giving this suggestion only because the other part in this part are clearly required to be decimal, so when I read this part I misunderstood the definition of nonzero real number where __***both***__ nonzero decimal __***AND OCTAL***__ interger is accpted.

But anyway this is only my perspective. My roomate wasn't bothered at this part and she thought that I had been thinking too much :P
